( C ) - Jerome Laliag, For the Idea.

He founded that expanding the Router Linux Embedded Capabilities can open gateways for OpenVPN, ShadowSocks, and STunnel. This way the VPN Router can have the ability to use Native Linux Commands under the same Idea as is on the PC based applications. The idea behind Yosef Project is my Sudo Name. I will recreate the VPN Router Modems with another agenda as this. Henceforth allowing users to have a Friendly based UI / UX Router VPNs that can connect freely without hassle.

( C ) - Love Tacome, For the Files.

She created and pulled out important files from VPN Modems before thus allowing free and reconfigurable VPN Modem Routers like HPWs and Huawei SIM-based Routers. As this was first founded and exploited on B315s-936, There's also a Possibility to expand towards other Modems like B310As-938 and E5573Cs-933 MiFi and Portable Routers. The Files we're STunnel, ShadowSocks and OpenVPN Solo Files and ready for Expansion via CGI and Javascript.

( C ) - Zander Mazda, For B310As-938.

He founded a way to debrand the B310As-938 and Openline the Modem with the help of a few friends on the Modem Community. When he created a way to Linuxify the Modem with Native Linux Commands, With the Help of Jerome Laliag, They both created a Lite Version of the OpenVPN Portal as thereforth created a OpenVPN Router Opportunity on Modems like HPWs.

( C ) - Snowflakes, All the Files will be kept here.

Especially downloads and other necessary and important files for the OpenVPN Portals, I will create a Walkthrough of Project Yosef once the initial startup is done, And I will enhance the Firmware Features like Added UI / UX Panel without the use of BusyBox and Port 8080. With this being said, I will also create a Necessary Backdoor Protection Program to monitor outgoing Packets and incoming Packets within the Modem, With Firewall Filtering schemes.
