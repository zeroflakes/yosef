# B315s-936 Modified Firmware

( C ) - Jerome Laliag, For the Idea.

He founded that expanding the Router Linux Embedded Capabilities can open gateways for OpenVPN, ShadowSocks, and STunnel. This way the VPN Router can have the ability to use Native Linux Commands under the same Idea as is on the PC based applications. The idea behind Yosef Project is my Sudo Name. I will recreate the VPN Router Modems with another agenda as this. Henceforth allowing users to have a Friendly based UI / UX Router VPNs that can connect freely without hassle.

( C ) - Love Tacome, For the Files.

She created and pulled out important files from VPN Modems before thus allowing free and reconfigurable VPN Modem Routers like HPWs and Huawei SIM-based Routers. As this was first founded and exploited on B315s-936, There's also a Possibility to expand towards other Modems like B310As-938 and E5573Cs-933 MiFi and Portable Routers.

( C ) - Zander Mazda, For B310As-938.

He founded a way to debrand the B310As-938
